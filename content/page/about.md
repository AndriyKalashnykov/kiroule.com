### Igor Baiborodine

I am a DevOps enthusiast with a keen interest in system administration, virtualization, cloud computing&storage and Python programming. Previously, before transitioning to DevOps,  I had worked as a Java developer for 11 years. You can find more detailed information about my professional experience in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igorbaiborodine).
