By this blog post, I start a series of articles where I share my experience in how to start a journey as a blogger from a technical perspective. This tutorial will show you how to set up from scratch a blog using GitHub, Hugo and Netlify.

So, you decided to start blogging, and you need to set up a blog. But from where to start? It all depends on your technical skillset. If you are not a geeky person, maybe a better approach would be to use such blogging platforms as [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/create-blog/) or [Wix.com](https://www.wix.com/start/blog). But if you are skilled in software development or any other related field, creating your blog with GitHub, Hugo and Netlify is the way to go.  What are the advantages of using the GitHub-Hugo-Netlify combination? 

First of all, to create content, you will use Markdown, a lightweight markup language. It offers a simple formatting syntax and cross-platform portability. Also, you can use pure HTML within content written in Markdown. 

Secondly, all your website content will be built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), an open-source static site generator. It provides excellent performance, numerous out-of-the-box features, fast built-in server reloads and plenty of [themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) to choose from.

Thirdly, using Netlify to deploy and host websites is simple and straightforward. Netlify offers a free tier plan, which is more than enough for any static website implemented with GitHub and Hugo.  Netlify's Continuous Deployment feature, in conjunction with GitHub, substantially helps in automating the content publishing workflow.

But enough talk, let's get started. The tutorial below consist of the following steps:
1. [Install Hugo](#install-hugo)
2. [Create New Website](#create-about-page)
3. [Customize Example Website](#customize-example-website)
4. [Create About Page](#create-about-page)
5. [Push Git Repository to GitHub](#push-git-repository-to-github)
6. [Deploy on Netlify](#deploy-on-netlify)

Among the prerequisites for this tutorial is a basic knowledge of Git with its command-line interface and GitHub/Netlify accounts. As a host operating system, I will be using Ubuntu 18.04.
