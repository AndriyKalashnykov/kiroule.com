In this post, I continue extending my website's capabilities by adding new functionality, namely the series taxonomy. It's based on Hugo's built-in support of user-defined groupings of content. This article is the sixth part of the [series "Building Your Blog, the Geeky Way"](https://www.kiroule.com/article/building-your-blog-the-geeky-way/).

As per [Hugo's documentation](https://gohugo.io/content-management/taxonomies), a taxonomy defined as follows:
> a categorization that can be used to classify content

Hugo provides native support for taxonomies, including two default ones: `tags` and `categories`. That means that no matter what theme you choose for your website, tag and category taxonomies will be automatically generated by Hugo.

Taxonomy is structurally defined using terms and values where the `term` is a key within the taxonomy, and the `value` is a piece of content assigned to a term. Using the `tags` taxonomy as an example, content relationships can be displayed as follows:

    Taxonomy  "Tag"
    Term        "Hugo"
    Value         "Start Blogging With Hugo, GitHub and Netlify"
    Value         "Add Favicon to Hugo-Based Website"
    Value         "Manage Environment-Specific Settings for Hugo-Based Website"

The example above presents content relationships from the taxonomy's perspective. Here is how it looks from the perspective of the content:

    Value     "Start Blogging With Hugo, GitHub and Netlify"
    Taxonomy    "Tags"
    Term          "Hugo"
    Term          "GitHub"
    Term          "Netlify"

Usually, when you publish a series of articles, it's a good practice to add `Next` and `Previous` links at the end of an article that is part of the series. Instead, I opted for listing all articles in the series. Therefore, every time a new post in the series is published, I have to manually add a link to the newly published article in every previously published series' article.

One of the solutions is to create a shortcode to encapsulate such a list of article links. With this approach, you add this shortcode to the end of each series' article, and when a new article is published, you only need to update the shortcode. So every time you start a new series, you have to create its proper shortcode.

But it is possible to parameterize such a shortcode by passing the series name as an argument. In this case, the content should be somehow classified so that we can retrieve the corresponding articles. To help us group the content, we can implement the series taxonomy.

Now let's take a closer look at the implementation of this solution:
{{< toc >}}

Add series taxonomies.

It could be applied to the Hugo theme of your choice or directly to your website.
